# Final project

## Comunication protocol

1. Slack will be use as our main comunication channel.

2. Knowledge base
If the team has a searchable knowledge base, then everyone has access to all the information they might need. Instead of sending out a query and disrupting someone elseâ€™s workflow to get the answer, they can search and find it for themselves.

4. Set expectations around response rates

Slack messages are expected to be responded within the following 24 hours

5. Emergency protocols

A text to the group (imessage) after hours / before recurring meeting signals that something needs to be deal with immediately/ASAP, whereas a late night slack message can be handled in the morning.
