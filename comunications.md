# Final project

## Comunication protocol

1. Slack will be use as our main comunication channel.

2. Knowledge base
If the team has a searchable knowledge base, then everyone has access to all the information they might need. Instead of sending out a query and disrupting someone else’s workflow to get the answer, they can search and find it for themselves.

3. Recurring meetings
Tuesdays and thursdays 6:15 to 6:30pm

Tuesdays and thursdays 9:00 to 9:30pm

4. Set expectations around response rates

Consider whether these should be different by email versus a communication tool like Slack. Whether it’s 1 hour, or 3 hours, or 24, one way to help your team meet these expectations is to encourage employees to have scheduled “breaks” from their work specifically to check email and messages. For example, messages get checked and responded to at 9 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m. Imagine how much deep work can get done in between those email breaks. Managers tend to set the bar for expected communication, but employees should gauge when they are most productive and save that time for focused work, and schedule email breaks during less optimal timeframes.

5. Emergency protocols

 For example, a text to the group (imessage) after hours / before class signals that something needs to be deal with immediately, whereas a late night email / late night slack messages can be handled in the morning.

 6. Bring in efficiency tools
We'll be tracking everyone's tasks
