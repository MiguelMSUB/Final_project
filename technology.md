## Data Cleaning and Analysis (Extract, Load and Transform)

The data that we will extract may need to be filtered, parsed, translated, sorted, interpolated, pivoted, summarized, aggregated, merged, or more. The goal is to create a consistent structure in the data. Without a consistent structure in our data, it's almost impossible to perform any meaningful analysis. This transformation phase can be accomplished with Pandas and Python. We have decided to use these tools Python and Pandas because they provide flexibility and interactivity (especially in a Jupyter Notebook).

Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter notebook files are great for sharing code. Since Jupyter Notebook is run in a browser, we will be able to easily share our analysis within our team members. All members will need to do is download the file and run the code we provide.

VS Code
We'll also be using VS Code in this project to create our Flask application.

## Database Storage

PostgreSQL

## Machine Learning

SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard

In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___.
