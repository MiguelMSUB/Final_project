There are several questions to keep in mind as you work through this segment:

Logistic regression model: 

How does it work?
Logistic regression model is a machine learning technique used for classification or prediction in data sets which have many features, but where most of them have little value and should be ignored. This model analyzes relationships between these input features (variables) and then when presented with a new sample, mathematically will determine its probability of beloging to a class . The output of this model is always binary outcomes (0/1, True/False, Yes/No ), that means there are only two possible outcomes. In our project we are expecting to get one of two answers: the job posting is fake or is not fake. 


Why this specific model?
Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.

What is the model's accuracy?

If there are statistics involved, what stats are being included in analysis and why?

If no statistics are involved, what would you include if you had more time?
