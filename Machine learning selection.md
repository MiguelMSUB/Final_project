## Model Evaluation and Validation

The final model used for this analysis is Random Forest Classifier.  This is based on the results of the type of data set that we are using for this problem. 

As we mentioned before in the advantages and disadvantages of the two models previously selected for this project, the Random Forest Classifier work well with both categorical and numerical data. Besides that no scaling or transformation of variables is necessary, so that will help us to save a lot of time cleaning the data. Finally because this model also provides a very nice output with variable importance. This interpretation can help you go beyond an accurate prediction and comment on what's more important in achieving the prediction and why.

Justification
As mentioned above, the final model performs better than the established benchmark of the baseline model. The model will be able to identify real jobs with a very high accuracy. However, itâ€™s identification of fake jobs can still be improved upon.
